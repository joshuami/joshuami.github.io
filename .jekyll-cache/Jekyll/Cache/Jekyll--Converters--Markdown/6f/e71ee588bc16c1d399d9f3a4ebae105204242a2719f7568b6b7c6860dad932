I"Ú<p>I just finished updating the theme for Portland Tillamook Cooperative Preschoolâ€™s Web site using the Dreamhost one-click installer. (Well, it was their one-click updater really.)</p>

<p>Two very valuable lessons were learned.</p>

<p>One, Dreamhost likes to overwrite any existing themes with the same names (directories) as the themes installed with their default. This means anyone who has simply edited a default theme will lose their edits.</p>

<p>The second lesson I learned is that their default backup of the site to a directory with â€œ.oldâ€ at the end is a very handy failsafe. Oddly enough, I did not have a local copy saved before clicking â€œupgrade.â€ A rare data-related mistake that I will not repeat.
On a final note, I certainly appreciate that Dreamhost installs some rather interesting themes with their one-click installer, but I wish it werenâ€™t so many. It really slows down the page load on presentations. It also takes a while to delete them all.</p>
