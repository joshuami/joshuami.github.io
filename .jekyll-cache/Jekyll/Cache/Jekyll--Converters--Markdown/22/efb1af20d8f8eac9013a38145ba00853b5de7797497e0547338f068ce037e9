I"ﬁ<p>In the course of handing off a project to another company, I just had the opportunity to say ‚Äújust build them <a href="http://www.boxesandarrows.com/">Boxes and Arrows</a> on <a href="https://www.drupal.org/">Drupal</a> and they‚Äôll be thrilled.‚Äù While I was merely using hyperbole to make a point, it got be thinking. What do they use to deliver their content?</p>

<p>The answer is <a href="http://publicsquarehq.com">PublicSquare</a>. This is a subscription-based service for creating an online magazine with a community component. I‚Äôve always like the layout and general functionality of Boxes and Arrows and now I know what they use to serve up their content.</p>

<p>I plan to look into this a bit more as the idea of a subscription-based magazine CMS intruiges me. I would have signed up for an account today, but it turns out that they have an expired security certificate on their account sign up page. I wonder if they know that?¬† (It expired on December 6, 2007.)</p>
