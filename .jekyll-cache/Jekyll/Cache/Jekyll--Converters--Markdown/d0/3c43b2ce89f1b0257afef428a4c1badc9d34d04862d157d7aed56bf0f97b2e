I"Ð<p>In May, <a href="http://joshuami.com/2016/05/31/saying-goodbye/">I announced my departure from the Drupal Association</a>. Since my last day on June 10th, it has been a whirlwind of family events punctuated by conversations with organizations big and small about opportunities. There were so many cool places that Iâ€™ve talked to about what makes their work special. It was not an easy decision to pick a spot to landâ€”it was even harder to end the month of extended family vacation. So much hiking and running and driving!</p>

<p>Iâ€™m excited to start at Phase2 as Director of Engineering on Monday, July 18th. Iâ€™ve long been a fan of Jeff and Frank and the incredible business and team culture theyâ€™ve built.</p>
