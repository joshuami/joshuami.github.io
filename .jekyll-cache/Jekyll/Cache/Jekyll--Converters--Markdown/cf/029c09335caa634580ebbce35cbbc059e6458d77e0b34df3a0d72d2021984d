I"ª<p>Iâ€™ve been running into this conundrum a lot lately. What makes something a configuration task versus a coding (or programming if you like) task?</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve come up with a series of equations that I think explain the issue:</p>

<p>XML == config file
Apache  !=  config file</p>

<p>GUI == configuration task
text file != configuration task</p>

<p>settings == configuration
syntax == programming</p>

<p>praise == configuration
profanity == programming or a really bad UI</p>

<p>So it comes down to this. If you want to produce software for people to use, make it configurable. Iâ€™m tired of running into software that has no discernible administrative featuresâ€“just a giant text file that is titled â€œconfigâ€ or something similar.</p>

<p>I recently used Wordpress to help a friend launch a portfolio site. It ended up being the siteâ€™s CMS (Content Management System). Wordpress is not the best CMS available, but it is a simple solution that has a well-developed configuration model. That is not to say that I didnâ€™t end up programming a bit in PHPâ€“I certainly got my hands dirty. About half of what I did in the end was configuration and the other half was coding.</p>
