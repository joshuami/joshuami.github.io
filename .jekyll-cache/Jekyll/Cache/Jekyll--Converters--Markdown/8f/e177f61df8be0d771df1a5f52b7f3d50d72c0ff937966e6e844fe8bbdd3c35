I"Ä<p>I just took a look the features and FAQ for the new <a href="http://www.movabletype.com/products/community-solution.html">Movable Type Community Solution</a></p>

<p>The community solution boasts the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Member registration with extended user profiles</li>
  <li>Forums</li>
  <li>Community blogs</li>
  <li>Custom fields</li>
  <li>Recommendation engine</li>
  <li>Sort-by-popularity</li>
</ul>

<p>The feature set overlaps heavily with [Clearspace X}(http://www.jivesoftware.com/products/clearspace/clearspacex.jsp) from Jive Software. Iâ€™ve seen Clearspace up close, and I think it is a great product, but a community site based on the code of Movable Type with its extensive plugin architecture and significant user base could be a significant competitor. Equally compelling for smaller organizations would the combination of WordPress and BBPress as both are completely opensourceâ€”free as in beer, but arguably less stable due to the more rapid release cycle. The growth of solutions in this space has been rapid. There seems to be plenty of room in the blog/community solution space for more players. It should be an interesting market to watch grow over the next couple of years.</p>
