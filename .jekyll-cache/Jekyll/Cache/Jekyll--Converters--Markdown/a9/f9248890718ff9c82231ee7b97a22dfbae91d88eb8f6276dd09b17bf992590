I"<p><a href="http://campaignmonitor.cmail2.com/e/247188/xt64iir/">Campaign Monitor’s September 2007 Newsletter</a> is packed with great stuff. Besides the design gallery, which is always a treat, the newsletter highlights <a href="http://www.campaignmonitor.com/blog/archives/2007/09/why_we_need_web_standards_supp_1.html">David Griener’s treatise on the state of email standards</a> (great read) and throws out an article on <a href="http://www.campaignmonitor.com/blog/archives/2007/08/improve_your_deliverability_wi_1.html">email authentication</a>–which is so very timely. Don’t get me started on the new suppression list feature–handy–and the new women’s t-shirts! (Okay, so I’m not really in need of the women’s t-shirts, but I’m sure they make someone happy.)</p>
