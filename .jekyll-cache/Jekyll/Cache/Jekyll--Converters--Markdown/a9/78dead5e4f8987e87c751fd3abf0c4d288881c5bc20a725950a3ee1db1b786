I"‚<p>At DrupalCon Seattle, I presented <a href="https://events.drupal.org/seattle2019/sessions/content-structures-government-websites-build-plan-portlandgov">Architecting government websites: migrating Portland.gov to Drupal 8</a>. Unfortunately, the 90-minute sessions were not recorded this year. I have had a lot of requests for more information about the project with Portland and the <a href="https://events.drupal.org/sites/default/files/slides/Migrating%20Portlandgov%20DrupalCon%20Seattle2019%20compressed.pdf">slides from the presetation</a>.</p>

<p>We posted an overview of the project on our beta site. <a href="https://beta.portland.gov/powr/about">About the POWR project</a>â€”we do love our acronyms in government. This overview takes a high-level walk through the project and its objectives. A migration of this scale is <strong>not a small project</strong>, but the eGovernment team at the City of Portland have been amazingâ€”and a ton of progress has been made. The hardest part of an effort like this is the wrangling of stakeholders across over 30 offices and hundreds of existing editors.</p>

<p>It still feels like we are on track for a 2019 switchover of <a href="https://www.portlandoregon.gov/">PortlandOregon.gov</a> over to the new <a href="https://portland.gov/">Portland.gov</a>. I cannot wait to see how the public responds to the new site when we start marketing the switch!</p>
