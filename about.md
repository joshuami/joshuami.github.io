## Why I do what I do (I'm passionate):
People need the Web. To put it simply, I like building great software for **people**. I devote time in every project to listening to the users of the tools I help build.

I believe the Web can and should make communication and collaboration easier. I enjoy finding simple solutions for difficult problems.

Iâ€™m particularly found of open source solutions integrated with best-in-class cloud services.
