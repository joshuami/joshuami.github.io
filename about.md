## Why I do what I do (I'm passionate):
With over 10 years of experience in technology leadership, product management, and web development, I help large organizations implement transformative digital solutions and improve their day-to-day operations. I am the founder of M6L LLC, a consulting firm that provides coaching, strategic direction, and technical implementation to clients across various sectors and industries.

My mission is to engage the customer in the software development lifecycle (SDLC) of their digital products, and to teach management how to invest in DevOps and a CI/CD workflow to improve cost, quality, and time to release. I have successfully launched and migrated web platforms for Washington County and the City of Portland, using Jira, ServiceNow, Github, CircleCI, Pantheon, Acquia as the core tools and frameworks. I also deliver training, presentations, and workshops to end users, stakeholders, and senior leaders, and conduct surveys, usability testing, and community engagement to ensure site satisfaction. I am passionate about finding simple solutions for difficult problems, and building the careers of smart and capable people.
