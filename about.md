## Why I do what I do (I'm passionate):
People need the Web. I like building great sites and web-based software for people. I devote time in every project to listening to the people who will use the tools I help build.
I believe the Web can and should make communication and collaboration easier. I enjoy finding simple solutions for difficult problems.
I prefer open source technologies, and Iâ€™m particularly found of Drupal.
