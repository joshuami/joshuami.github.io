title: Two switches in one weekend

Along with the switch to Wordpress, I have also moved MobileHippie.com to my Dreamhost account. UplinkEarth still has a couple of my sites, but I'm consciously making an effort to move anything that uses Wordpress to a Linux server running Apache so that I get the full power of the software.

IIS and Wordpress were not meant for each other. I'm not really sure why ULE decided to make Wordpress a one-click install on their shared Windows hosting. It doesn't work properly as there is no PHP mail function and there is no ability to use formated permalinks. Seems like a poor business choice to offer something that's basic functionality isn't supported.
