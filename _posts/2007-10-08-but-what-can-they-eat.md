title: But what CAN they eat?
---

A concerned parent intending to bring snacks to my son's third-grade class wanted to make sure the food she brought would be appropriate for everyone in the class, so she put together a list of food that were acceptable:
<blockquote>These are all vegetarian, wheat free, dairy free, soy free (all oil will specifically be canola to avoid soy), free of artificial flavors, synthetic colors, BHA, BHT, TBHQ, and as far as I can tell, free of citric acid (I'm not sure what all is in this category—citrus fruits, berries, pineapple, tamarind, cherries, tomatoes, cayenne, artichokes, lettuce, cheese (ruled out by dairy anyway), and sourdough).</blockquote>


So what CAN they eat? I was surprised to see a list of five options:
<ul>
	<li>Frozen grapes &amp; pistachios</li>
	<li>Banana bread with peanut butter</li>
	<li>Pumpkin muffins with almond butter</li>
	<li>Greek lentil soup with cornbread muffins made with rice milk</li>
	<li>Steel cut oats with vanilla, maple syrup and toasted pecan</li>
</ul>

...so apparently we don't have any nut allergies. Does anyone else find this list of allergies peculiar?
