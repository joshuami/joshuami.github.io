title: FreshBooks is hiring again

<a href="http://www.freshbooks.com/blog/2007/09/07/watch-out-film-fest-here-comes-freshbooks/">FreshBooks is hiring again</a>.

This is quite possibly the most inventive call for applicants I have ever seen. Proof that with a burgeoning company and a copy of iMovie you can make yourself look like fools, but still come off in a positive light.

Nice job FreshBooks.
