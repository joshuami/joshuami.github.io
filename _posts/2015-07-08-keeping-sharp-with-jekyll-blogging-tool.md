title: Keeping sharp with Jekyll for blogging
---

To keep my skills sharp, I have started a series a Friday experiments. This Friday, I decided to explore moving my personal site—which was moved to Drupal 7 last year off of a Wordpress installation—to a Jekyll installation with Github Pages integration.

Another key reason to test the Jekyll experience is that it has become a frequently used tool in creating headless Drupal installations. (Headless is something I am very keen to try at some point.)

To pull this together I used the following resources:

* [Joshua Lande's excellent run down](http://joshualande.com/jekyll-github-pages-poole/) of how he migrated his personal blog
* [Jekyll's complete—but rather esoteric—documentation](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/home/)
* [GitHub's documentation on using Jekyll with GitHub Pages](https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-with-pages/)

Instead of the default [Poole](http://getpoole.com/) layouts that Lande used, I decided to go with [Hyde](https://github.com/poole/hyde).

So far, I'm enjoying typing a post directly into markdown rather than a bloated WYSIWYG. We'll see if that encourages me to write a bit more.
