title: Marketplace Updates to Highlight Contributing Organizations

We are excited to announce some big changes to the <a href="https://www.drupal.org/drupal-services">Drupal.org Marketplace</a>. In <a href="http://amsterdam2014.drupal.org/session/keynote-dries-buytaert.html">Dries’ Amsterdam Keynote</a>, he made a compelling case for showing the contributions of organizations that are helping build Drupal. By highlighting organizations that give their employees time to give back, we make it possible for more people to give time to making the project better.

In March, we took steps to begin collecting this information by allowing individuals that were contributing in the issue queues to attribute their contributions to organization that they are employed by or customers that funded the work. When a maintainer of a project (module, theme, distribution or Drupal Core) closes an issue as fixed, they have an opportunity to <a href="https://www.drupal.org/node/2495315/">pass on credit</a> to the individuals who helped contribute to fixing the issue—and not just code contributions, but any kind of feedback, review, designs, etc. 

We called this system issue credits and it has been a huge success. We now show the last 90 days of issue credits awarded to an individual or organization on their profile.

Today, after months of collecting this data, we are taking how we highlight contributing organizations to a new level.

With this launch, we are removing the distinction of "featured service providers" versus "all service providers". By using data about these organizations contributions, we can provide a single list of all organizations ordered by their contributions. 

For now, we are using issue credits as the primary sort. The secondary sort highlights organizations that are giving back by supporting Drupal.org through the supporting partner program or organization membership. Soon, we plan to incorporate case studies submitted, DrupalCon sponsorships, and camp sponsorships to help make a more complete picture of how organizations are contributing to our community.
