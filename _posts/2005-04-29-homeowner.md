title: I'm a homeowner
---

<p>Well, it might be more appropriate to say that we, my wife and I, are considerably indebted to the bank with a small amount of equity due to an excellent purchase price.</p>
<p>The hurry-up-and-wait process ended this morning in a flurry of activity that began with a phone call late yesterday afternoon.</p>
<p>So to sum up the week, my daughter couldn't hold down anything on Thursday; the title company called yesterday and wanted us to sign with two hours notice&mdash;we declined until this morning due to "scheduling" issues, but were fine with signing first thing this morning; which we did, despite the fact I was awoken this morning by my son's projectile vomitting in my face.  (Yes, you read that correctly.)</p>
<p>The next two weeks are guaranteed to be crazy, but at least I have my Internet connection back&mdash;oh yes, that is another story for another day.</p>
