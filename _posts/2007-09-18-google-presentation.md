title: Google "Presentation" in the Wild
---

<a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2007/09/our-feature-presentation.html">Google adds Presentation to Google Docs</a>. Interesting tool. I particularly like the feature that lets you publish the document and share a chat room and the presentation at once. Pretty quick way to set up a meeting. That said, I'm probably not giving up <a href="http://www.apple.com/keynote/">Keynote</a> for it.
