title: Drupal.org is staffing up
---

<a href="https://assoc.drupal.org/blog/joshuami/drupalorg-staffing">Reposted from Drupal Association website</a>

<p>The Drupal Association Board of Directors has committed to significantly improving Drupal.org in 2014. As a result, we are staffing up, working with contractors, and improving volunteer engagement paths so that we can really accelerate change on the site this year and keep the momentum going into next year.</p>
<h3>
	What&rsquo;s next for Drupal.org?</h3>
<p>The primary imperative outlined in our 2014 Leadership Plan and Budget is to make Drupal.org shine. Here are the things I am going to be focused on most immediately to that end:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		Working Groups: Work with the Software, Infrastructure, and Content Working Groups to quickly get up to speed and further clarify processes and systems so we can accelerate decision making for Drupal.org</li>
	<li>
		Build a strong internal team at the Association and put systems and process in place to support a more transparent and routine deployment process.</li>
	<li>
		There is a fair amount of technical debt to pay off. We&rsquo;ll be focusing on two types of projects:
		<ul>
			<li>
				removing potential blockers to a Drupal 8 release (i.e. improving testbot performance and implementing semantic versioning in our git repositories)</li>
			<li>
				accelerating volunteer involvement</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
<h3>
	We are adding infrastructure, engineering and design staff</h3>
<p>Through most of 2013, we had two technical positions on the Drupal Association staff. This was not enough to do much more that keep up with pressing issues in the issue queue and support the volunteers put in massive work in maintaining our infrastructure. In 2014, we are hiring the following positions:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		CTO of Drupal.org (that&rsquo;s me)</li>
	<li>
		Drupal.org Infrastructure Manager (filled)</li>
	<li>
		<a href="https://assoc.drupal.org/jobs#op-30612-drupalorg-devops-engineer">Drupal.org DevOps Engineer</a> (currently posted)</li>
	<li>
		<a href="https://assoc.drupal.org/jobs#op-33504-drupalorg-securityarchitecture-engineer">Drupal.org Security/Architecture Engineer</a> (currently posted)</li>
	<li>
		<a href="https://assoc.drupal.org/jobs#op-33505-drupalorg-qa-engineer">Drupal.org QA Engineer</a> (currently posted)</li>
</ul>
<p>We also need design (theming) and UX support to help push us forward. To that end, we are posting three positions with the intent to get the best possible single hire for 2014.</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		<a href="https://assoc.drupal.org/jobs#op-33499-drupalorg-product-manager">Drupal.org Product Manager</a> (currently posted)</li>
	<li>
		<a href="https://assoc.drupal.org/jobs#op-33503-drupalorg-web-designer">Drupal.org Web Designer</a> (currently posted)</li>
	<li>
		<a href="https://assoc.drupal.org/jobs#op-33501-drupalorg-user-experience-engineer">Drupal.org User Experience Engineer</a> (currently posted)</li>
</ul>
<p>Additional design and user experience positions are planned for 2015. We will continue shore up our technical team with committed volunteers and will also be looking to strategically use contractors to move important projects forward.</p>
