Until then, here are a few salient points:<\/p><ul>        <li>Fast. Signup is quick and easy and the tool itself it lightning quick.<\/li>        <li>Free.

You don't have to accept any of these offers to take advantage of the free account.<\/li>        <li>Easy to use. Mint downloads all of your transactions through your banks online services. (The list of banks is impressive. All three banks I use for checking, savings or credit are in their database.) Once transactions are downloaded, their algorithm goes to town figuring out how you spent your money and giving you shiny reports and pie charts.

They are <a href=\"http:\/\/www.truste.org\/\">TRUSTe<\/a> certified and they use a third party service called <a href=\"http:\/\/www.yodlee.com\/\">Yodlee<\/a> to verify your account credentials so they don't have to store them on their servers.<\/li><\/ul><p>So the only thing that really scares me about this service is how much they will know about you in such a short period of time.
