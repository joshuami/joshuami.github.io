Needless to say, I have more than 10 recommendations at this point. To that end, I'm revisiting this important topic as of August 2025.<\/p><h2>First things first<\/h2><p>The best practices below apply to any website, but I focus on government websites because of their impact. These recommendations apply regardless of country or level of government organization (nation\/federal, state\/province, local jurisdictions, etc.). That said, the more immigration a country has, the greater the impact created by the translation of governmental resources.<\/p><h2>Know who will benefit from translation<\/h2><p>Governments should know demographic information and literacy rates through a combination of census, survey, and immigration data. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.census.gov\/newsroom\/press-releases\/2025\/2017-2021-acs-language-use-tables.html\">Census.gov provides some detailed information as a starting point for areas within the United States<\/a>. Some jurisdictions may have local resources that dive deeper. And example is the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.oregon.gov\/languages\/pages\/common-language-county.aspx\">common languages by county breakdown by the State of Oregon<\/a> which was analyzed and compiled by the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.pdx.edu\/population-research\/\">Portland State University Population Research Center<\/a>.<\/p><p>Demographic data will explain the scope of the possible impact for those that are bilingual, but only by understanding literacy rates can an organization understand the possible reach of translated materials. Pockets of recent immigrants may have a greater need despite a relatively small populations. I've seen this first-hand at the school where my wife is principal. The student population of this school in East Portland, Oregon speaks 27 languages at home. Needless to say, her staff has become incredibly proficient at using translation aids with students and parents. (Sadly, their website is not even close to translated adequately.)<\/p><p>Understanding the population impacted by limited proficiency in the source language can be combined with knowledge of the non-government and government organizations supporting these populations. For instance, you might be able to get a fair amount of data from organizations like IRCO (The Immigrant and Refugee Community Organization.<\/p><p>Analytics may also provide some insight\u2014especially if your jurisdiction is popular with tourists visiting from outside your country.<\/p><h2>Avoid the client-side translation crutch<\/h2><drupal-media data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"f70a2363-0bae-45a7-81da-aba2c1fbcbd0\" data-align=\"right\" data-caption=\"Why do people assume that someone needing translation can read a word to toggle translation in a language other than the one they speak?\">&nbsp;<\/drupal-media><p>Many government websites rely on the deprecated <a href=\"https:\/\/developers.google.com\/search\/blog\/2020\/05\/google-translates-website-translator\">Google Translate Website Translator<\/a> to provide access to community members with limited proficiency in the provided language.<\/p><p>The Google Translate Website Translator provides essentially the same level of site translation as submitting a URL to <a href=\"https:\/\/translate.google.com\/\">translate.google.com<\/a>, but without the visual cues to help a community member understand that the translation is not being provided by the site.<\/p><p>Even the developers behind this service will admit it is a crutch to shore up the lack of full translation. The pandemic and the demand to translate health and safety information are why the <a href=\"https:\/\/developers.google.com\/search\/blog\/2020\/05\/google-translates-website-translator\">widget was partially revived from deprecation<\/a>. Basically, the governments, non-profits, and non-commercial websites allowed to use the widget are the sites that should not.&nbsp;<\/p><p>Client-side (browser-based) widgets are an incomplete and misleading solution.<\/p><p>Policy makers, that speak the language of the government providing the content, assume the widget is providing access to critical content. Aside from providing an easy link to multilingual visitors, client-side translation is not increasing access.<\/p><p>Community members with limited language proficiency that use government websites tend to be familiar with services to help them translate their content. Browsers, such as Chrome or Edge, will automatically attempt to translate pages in a language other than the system or browser setting. There are also dedicated mobile apps to help with client-side translation.<\/p><p>If you speak enough of a language to find a page on a website, you probably know enough to figure out how to translate the page you found.<\/p><p>The real equity issue is finding content in the first place if you don\u2019t speak the language.<\/p><p>Websites that do not have translated content using an alternate URL are not being fully indexed in target languages by search engines such as Google, Bing, DuckDuckGo, etc. That means people who speak a language other than those used in fully-translated content are unable to use their language to search<\/p><p>At a minimum, governments should consider automating the translation of content using machine translation\u2014usually via a web service that returns translated content\u2014that is stored in the database for presentation at a unique URL. It\u2019s important that this content is rendered as HTML as a language alternative for the source language rather than being rendered by Javascript in the browser.<\/p><h2>Review translations with human professionals<\/h2><p>While there are techniques for getting Google to index rendered Javascript, these approaches are not always reliable. Even though machine learning has progressed to the point that proxy-delivered translation is much more accurate, it still needs human review as of 2023.<\/p><p>Best practice for all government websites should be full translation at a unique URL in a culturally appropriate design that may be translated by an on-demand service (for speed) but must be reviewed by skilled human translators for accuracy.<\/p><p>That said, I'm not certain that relying on humans alone is adequate for all circumstances. In a project with the City of Portland, we compared interface translation\u2014elements like the \"home\" link or the \"search\" form\u2014that was done by a translation agency to the same translation generated through the Google Translate API. We were fortunately enough to have bilingual speakers of Spanish, Chinese, and Vietnamese on the team to review the results. Surprisingly, for these elements of the user interface, Google did better. Perhaps it should not have been a surprise. These agencies more typically translate documents, which have far more context than interface elements.<\/p><p>The lesson learned was that you need to verify translations with trusted professionals regardless of whether you use human translators or machine translation\u2014or AI... more on that later.&nbsp;<\/p><h2>Help search engines rank content with proper metatags<\/h2><p>Search engines need data to help determine the relative importance of a page\u2014often in the form of metatags and HTML attributes. Search engines, such as Google, can use link elements (metatags) with a relationship (<code>rel=\u201dalternate\u201d<\/code>) and hreflang (<code>hreflang=\u201des\u201d<\/code>) attribute to help rank content. In this approach, the search engine gives a bit more relevance to translations (alternates) of pages that rank highly in English.<\/p><p>Hreflang can be used to boost the search engine relevance of content both by language and by country or region. For example, you might have content tagged with <code>hrefang=\"en-US\"<\/code> as well as <code>hreflang=\"en-CA\"<\/code> and <code>hreflang=\"en-GB\"<\/code>. They all represent English as the language, but there might be differences in tone or spelling. Most governments will find themselves using a single country code\u2014or omit the country code\u2014for all language codes used for their content.<\/p><p>Language codes are set by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), a governing body that defines language and region codes. It\u2019s not perfect\u2014and it is always changing\u2014but it serves as a means to ensure that the work you did to get your source content ranking will pass through to the content for your target languages.<\/p><p>Here is an extreme example of hreflang implemented on a set of sites spread around the world all for the same brand:<\/p><pre><code class=\"language-html\">&lt;link rel=\"alternate\" hreflang=\"en-AE\" href=\"https:\/\/www.cleanandcleararabia.com\/\"&gt;\r\n&lt;link rel=\"alternate\" hreflang=\"en-AU\" href=\"https:\/\/www.cleanandclear.com.au\/\"&gt;\r\n&lt;link rel=\"alternate\" hreflang=\"en-BH\" href=\"https:\/\/www.cleanandcleararabia.com\/\"&gt;\r\n&lt;link rel=\"alternate\" hreflang=\"en-CA\" href=\"https:\/\/www.cleanandclear.ca\/\"&gt;\r\n&lt;link rel=\"alternate\" hreflang=\"en-EG\" href=\"https:\/\/www.cleanandcleararabia.com\/\"&gt;\r\n&lt;link rel=\"alternate\" hreflang=\"en-GB\" href=\"https:\/\/www.cleanandclear.co.uk\/\"&gt;\r\n&lt;link rel=\"alternate\" hreflang=\"en-IN\" href=\"https:\/\/www.cleanandclear.in\/\"&gt;\r\n&lt;link rel=\"alternate\" hreflang=\"en-IQ\" href=\"https:\/\/www.cleanandcleararabia.com\/\"&gt;\r\n&lt;link rel=\"alternate\" hreflang=\"en-JO\" href=\"https:\/\/www.cleanandcleararabia.com\/\"&gt;\r\n&lt;link rel=\"alternate\" hreflang=\"en-KW\" href=\"https:\/\/www.cleanandcleararabia.com\/\"&gt;\r\n&lt;link rel=\"alternate\" hreflang=\"en-LB\" href=\"https:\/\/www.cleanandcleararabia.com\/\"&gt;\r\n&lt;link rel=\"alternate\" hreflang=\"en-MY\" href=\"https:\/\/www.cleanandclear.com.my\/\"&gt;\r\n&lt;link rel=\"alternate\" hreflang=\"en-NZ\" href=\"https:\/\/www.cleanandclear.co.nz\/\"&gt;\r\n&lt;link rel=\"alternate\" hreflang=\"en-OM\" href=\"https:\/\/www.cleanandcleararabia.com\/\"&gt;\r\n&lt;link rel=\"alternate\" hreflang=\"en-SA\" href=\"https:\/\/www.cleanandcleararabia.com\/\"&gt;\r\n&lt;link rel=\"alternate\" hreflang=\"en-SY\" href=\"https:\/\/www.cleanandcleararabia.com\/\"&gt;\r\n&lt;link rel=\"alternate\" hreflang=\"en-US\" href=\"https:\/\/www.cleanandclear.com\/homepage\"&gt;\r\n&lt;link rel=\"alternate\" hreflang=\"en-YE\" href=\"https:\/\/www.cleanandcleararabia.com\/\"&gt;\r\n&lt;link rel=\"alternate\" hreflang=\"fr-CA\" href=\"https:\/\/fr.cleanandclear.ca\/\"&gt;\r\n&lt;link rel=\"alternate\" hreflang=\"id-ID\" href=\"https:\/\/cleanandclear.co.id\/\"&gt;\r\n&lt;link rel=\"alternate\" hreflang=\"ms-MY\" href=\"https:\/\/www.cleanandclear.com.my\/ms\"&gt;\r\n&lt;link rel=\"alternate\" hreflang=\"ru-RU\" href=\"https:\/\/www.cleanandclear.ru\/\"&gt;\r\n&lt;link rel=\"alternate\" hreflang=\"th-TH\" href=\"https:\/\/www.cleanandclear.co.th\/\"&gt;\r\n&lt;link rel=\"alternate\" hreflang=\"vi-VN\" href=\"https:\/\/www.cleanandclear.com.vn\/\"&gt;\r\n&lt;link rel=\"alternate\" hreflang=\"zh-hans-CN\" href=\"https:\/\/www.cleanandclear.com.cn\/\"&gt;<\/code><\/pre><p>Government sites likely won't have this complexity, but you may find it helpful to to include geographic data to help search engines know a bit more about the jurisdiction's location. Here's an example from Portland.gov:<\/p><pre><code class=\"language-html\">&lt;meta name=\"geo.placename\" content=\"Portland\" \/&gt;\r\n&lt;meta name=\"geo.region\" content=\"US-OR\" \/&gt;\r\n&lt;meta name=\"geo.position\" content=\"45.515012;-122.679096\" \/&gt;\r\n&lt;link rel=\"canonical\" href=\"https:\/\/www.portland.gov\/water\/customer-service\/pay-your-utility-bill\" \/&gt;\r\n&lt;link rel=\"alternate\" hreflang=\"x-default\" href=\"https:\/\/www.portland.gov\/water\/customer-service\/pay-your-utility-bill\" \/&gt;\r\n&lt;link rel=\"icon\" href=\"\/themes\/custom\/cloudy\/favicon.ico\" type=\"image\/vnd.microsoft.icon\" \/&gt;\r\n&lt;link rel=\"alternate\" hreflang=\"en\" href=\"https:\/\/www.portland.gov\/water\/customer-service\/pay-your-utility-bill\" \/&gt;\r\n&lt;link rel=\"alternate\" hreflang=\"es\" href=\"https:\/\/www.portland.gov\/es\/water\/customer-service\/pague-su-factura-de-alcantarillado-aguas-pluviales-y-agua\" \/&gt;\r\n&lt;link rel=\"alternate\" hreflang=\"vi\" href=\"https:\/\/www.portland.gov\/vi\/water\/customer-service\/thanh-toan-hoa-don-nuoc-thai-nuoc-mua-va-nuoc-cua-quy-vi\" \/&gt;\r\n&lt;link rel=\"alternate\" hreflang=\"zh-hans\" href=\"https:\/\/www.portland.gov\/zh-hans\/water\/customer-service\/zhifunindewushuiyushuihezilaishuizhangdan\" \/&gt;\r\n&lt;link rel=\"alternate\" hreflang=\"ru\" href=\"https:\/\/www.portland.gov\/ru\/water\/customer-service\/oplata-scheta-za-kanalizaciyu-drenazh-i-vodosnabzhenie\" \/&gt;<\/code><\/pre><p>The example from Portland.gov used a combination of the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.drupal.org\/project\/metatag\">Metatag<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.drupal.org\/project\/hreflang\">Hreflang<\/a> Drupal modules. To take it further, you can implement <a href=\"https:\/\/schema.org\/\">schema.org metadata<\/a>. All of this data will improve how search engines and AI interact with your content.<\/p><h2>Index content by language to improve site search<\/h2><p>In addition to making content available to search engines, full translation provides the opportunity to index text in a target language so that it can be found in site search. Sites that only use client-side machine translation lose the ability to submit forms to return search results in the target language. This is a huge loss of functionality! Would you find it acceptable if search could only return the occasional cognate or misspelling?<\/p><p>Languages have unique grammar and syntax. Languages have their own writing system (alphabet) and unique characters and accents. If the search engine cannot provide at least a rudimentary search in the language, it is likely to cause confusion and frustration.<\/p><p>For those that would argue that client-side translation is \u201cenough\u201d or \u201cthe best we can do\u201d, consider the basic usability of a site with thousands of pages of content where search is incomprehensible.<\/p><p>So if you are trying to create a translated search interface, then it should include the interface elements such as the forms and filters with translated results.<\/p><drupal-media data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"7f474372-bb28-4f2c-8ced-2862619c6a2f\" data-view-mode=\"large\">&nbsp;<\/drupal-media><h2>Design your website with culture and word length in mind<\/h2><p>Depending on the languages your site supports, you'll need to incorporate support for right to left languages and languages that have radically different word length for common user interface elements. (I'm looking at you German!)<\/p><p>In addition to reading direction and word length, you may want to consider cultural differences for things like color, imagery, and tone.<\/p><h2>Complex layouts cost more to translate<\/h2><p>Drupal sites love their site building capabilities. Whether you use Layout Builder or Paragraphs or perhaps you are pining for the release of <s>Experience Builder<\/s> (er...) Drupal Canvas. These tools for keeping your content as semantic and structured while still being dynamic with may different layouts and appearance add a lot of complexity for translation.<\/p><p>Think of it this way, if you have a body content field using CKEditor with content is is basically limited to semantic headings, lists, and paragraphs with minimal styling options, this field will be relatively each for a translator or translation API to replace that text with translation in a matching structure. Alternatively, if you have a complex layout builder solution with multiple sections that can accept a range of content blocks, each of those elements has to be submitted to the translation service. Each change to a block is a revision tied back to the overall content revision. These revision upon revision scenarios make it more and more difficult to ensure that each component is translated.<\/p><p>So in short, if you are going to do widespread translation of services that need to update with any regularity, keep the layouts simple.<\/p><h2>Avoid mixed translation<\/h2><p>While mixed content (partially translated content presented on the same page as the source language) is indexed, partial translation can impact the usability for both the reader with limited language proficiency as well as native speakers from the source languages of the content.<\/p><drupal-media data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"967cc10f-73fd-415c-bbaf-00f4851f4ab3\" data-view-mode=\"large\" data-caption=\"I hesitated a bit to share this example, but I think it is instructive of what mixed translation can do to the user experience. I wish I could sav it has been fixed, but at the time of this post being published the troubling news article from 2024 still mixes English and Spanish in a horrific way.\">&nbsp;<\/drupal-media><p>Clear, concise content is difficult to achieve on a page with multiple paragraphs or sections of paragraphs in two or more languages\u2014and the problem exacerbates as the number of languages presented increases.<\/p><h2>Help users understand the languages available<\/h2><p>Many websites that provide translated content will have a language switcher or toggle that allows users to quickly view the translated alternate for a page. Best practice is for this toggle to present the language label in the target language. So a site with translations in English, Spanish, Vietnamese, Russian, and Chinese would have language labels similar to this example from the Multnomah County Library.<\/p><drupal-media data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"c818c5ac-7cb7-450a-ad0f-b67ff8018311\" data-view-mode=\"large\">&nbsp;<\/drupal-media><p>When a language switch is presented as part of the navigation toolbar on a website, it is generally expected that it will switch into a fully translated version of that site with a starting point of the page being viewed.<\/p><p>For sites that do not have enough content translated to warrant a sitewide translation navigation, an in-page approach may be more appropriate. Here is an example from Portland.gov.<\/p><drupal-media data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"2715ec5d-1fc3-4847-8b8f-32799285ac2e\" data-view-mode=\"large\">&nbsp;<\/drupal-media><p>Finally, showing the related titles in the target language can be an excellent indicator to those with limited proficiency that are scanning the page for information. A title will actually tell them something about the content being linked\u2014far more than a language label.<\/p><p>Combining all three techniques is overwhelming, but sites should strive to combine a language label menu in either the sitewide or in-page navigation near the top of the site design with related translated titles after the content.<\/p><h2>Label downloadable files in other languages<\/h2><p>When possible, information should be provided as content on a website (semantically-structured HTML) rather than downloadable files. Regardless of format, HTML is likely the easiest to structure for accessibility, HTML content can be structured and styled for a range of device sizes and for screen reading technology. Files can be semantically structured for screen readers, but often fail to deliver a usable experience on mobile devices. (What device types would you assume to be most available to the population needing translation?)<\/p><p>If files are preferred because of the way the information should be conveyed, such as flyers that might be posted in locations where speakers of that language are likely to see them, it is important to provide context for the language used in the file. This is often referred to as dual labeling.<\/p><drupal-media data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"1d0561c4-2da9-406a-9f92-0f91462e455b\" data-view-mode=\"large\">&nbsp;<\/drupal-media><p>In the best examples of this approach, the source language of the document should be labeled next to the document name. Proper labeling is key to both the language speakers and those supporting those speakers that may not speak the target language.<\/p><p>Avoid links to files with text like \u201cclick here\u201d or \u201cdownload now\u201d and explain what is to be downloaded with a meaningful title, the file type, and file size to be downloaded.<\/p><p>File size is important. Large file sizes are inequitable for government information as only those with enough data can download them. There may be file types that are unavailable to the device type being used to access the information. Additionally, some file types are more difficult to make accessible in any language.<\/p><h2>Translating images and video<\/h2><p>Translated media that is related back to its source also makes it easier to see what has not been translated yet or when the media has outdated translations using tools like Drupal's <a href=\"https:\/\/www.drupal.org\/project\/tmgmt\">Translation Management Tool<\/a> module.&nbsp;<\/p><p>There is a lot of metadata for media like images, video, and audio in addition to the generated file that can be translated, including:<\/p><ul><li>Alternative text<\/li><li>Transcripts<\/li><li>Displayed titles<\/li><li>Closed captioning<\/li><\/ul><h2>Reduce translation costs with plain language<\/h2><p>The easiest way to reduce translation costs is to reduce the amount of text translated. Clear, concise content is easier for people to understand and costs less to maintain as well.<\/p><p>Here is an example of two passages generated with ChatGPT to meet different language levels:<\/p><table class=\"table\"><thead><tr><th>Post graduate reading level<\/th><th>8th-grade reading level<\/th><\/tr><\/thead><tbody><tr><td>Landscape design integrates ecological principles with aesthetic considerations to create harmonious outdoor spaces that serve both functional and experiential purposes. This discipline transcends mere garden planning; it involves a comprehensive understanding of environmental context, plant selection, and spatial dynamics. Effective landscape design addresses site-specific conditions\u2014such as topography, climate, and soil composition\u2014while also engaging with cultural and historical narratives. By employing sustainable practices, such as xeriscaping and native plant usage, landscape architects not only enhance biodiversity but also promote resilience against climate change. Ultimately, thoughtful landscape design cultivates a dialogue between human activity and the natural environment, fostering spaces that inspire connection, reflection, and stewardship.<\/td><td>Landscape design is about planning and creating beautiful outdoor spaces like parks and gardens. It involves picking the right plants, flowers, and trees to make a place look nice and useful. Good design considers the shape of the land, the weather, and the soil. Designers often use local plants that grow well and need less water, which helps the environment and supports wildlife. In short, landscape design aims to make outdoor areas that are pretty and enjoyable for everyone.<br>&nbsp;<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><p>As this example highlights, the sheer amount of text is vastly different.<\/p><h2>Start considering how AI might reduce translation costs while improving the quality<\/h2><p>AI translation is improving rapidly. In some ways, translation via a large language model (LLM) is one of the more mature uses of AI. However, the newer AI models like ChatGPT and Claude struggle a bit with some translation, creating passages of text that are grammatically accurate but not necessarily something any human would express. I don't expect this to be the case for long. Similar to the shift from search to using AI for internet queries, I think we will see a move from traditional translation APIs such as Google's or Microsoft's towards AI platforms. It's a huge challenge to how translation has worked for the past 10-15 years.<\/p><p>Drupal is poised to integrate well with these services. Drupal CMS even includes some basic \"translate using AI\" capabilities.<\/p><drupal-media data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"f945d747-ceec-4ffa-be6e-4b0a197a3900\" data-view-mode=\"large\">&nbsp;<\/drupal-media><p>The default prompt in the Drupal AI module for translation is helpful in understanding just how impactful AI translation might be.<\/p><pre><code class=\"language-plaintext\"> You are a helpful translator that can translate text and understand context when translating.\r\n You will be given a context text to translate from the source language {{ source_lang_name }}\r\n to the target language {{ dest_lang_name }}.\r\n Only respond with the actual translation and nothing else.\r\n When translating the context text from the source language {{ source_lang_name }}\r\n to the target language {{ dest_lang_name }} take the following instructions into consideration:\r\n 1.

Implementing translations on large sites serving a number of languages can be complex.&nbsp;<\/p><p>The initial investment in your content management systems is incremental compared to the impact.

Needless to say, I have more than 10 recommendations at this point. To that end, I'm revisiting this important topic as of August 2025.<\/p>\n<h2>First things first<\/h2>\n<p>The best practices below apply to any website, but I focus on government websites because of their impact. These recommendations apply regardless of country or level of government organization (nation\/federal, state\/province, local jurisdictions, etc.). That said, the more immigration a country has, the greater the impact created by the translation of governmental resources.<\/p>\n<h2>Know who will benefit from translation<\/h2>\n<p>Governments should know demographic information and literacy rates through a combination of census, survey, and immigration data. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.census.gov\/newsroom\/press-releases\/2025\/2017-2021-acs-language-use-tables.html\">Census.gov provides some detailed information as a starting point for areas within the United States<\/a>. Some jurisdictions may have local resources that dive deeper. And example is the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.oregon.gov\/languages\/pages\/common-language-county.aspx\">common languages by county breakdown by the State of Oregon<\/a> which was analyzed and compiled by the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.pdx.edu\/population-research\/\">Portland State University Population Research Center<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Demographic data will explain the scope of the possible impact for those that are bilingual, but only by understanding literacy rates can an organization understand the possible reach of translated materials. Pockets of recent immigrants may have a greater need despite a relatively small populations. I've seen this first-hand at the school where my wife is principal. The student population of this school in East Portland, Oregon speaks 27 languages at home. Needless to say, her staff has become incredibly proficient at using translation aids with students and parents. (Sadly, their website is not even close to translated adequately.)<\/p>\n<p>Understanding the population impacted by limited proficiency in the source language can be combined with knowledge of the non-government and government organizations supporting these populations. For instance, you might be able to get a fair amount of data from organizations like IRCO (The Immigrant and Refugee Community Organization.<\/p>\n<p>Analytics may also provide some insight\u2014especially if your jurisdiction is popular with tourists visiting from outside your country.<\/p>\n<h2>Avoid the client-side translation crutch<\/h2>\n\n\n<figure class=\"figure align-right\">\n      <div class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-medium\">\n  \n                    \t    <picture>\n                  <source srcset=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/uncropped_500w_webp\/public\/2025-08\/seattle-google-translate-widget.png.webp?itok=uQDew2uZ 500w, \/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/uncropped_600w_webp\/public\/2025-08\/seattle-google-translate-widget.png.webp?itok=evEmw4aE 600w\" media=\"all and (min-width: 500px)\" type=\"image\/webp\" sizes=\"100vw\" width=\"600\" height=\"192\">\n                  <img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/uncropped_500w_webp\/public\/2025-08\/seattle-google-translate-widget.png.webp?itok=uQDew2uZ\" alt=\"Seattle.gov currently uses the Google Translate Widget.\" title width=\"500\" height=\"160\" loading=\"lazy\" data-component-id=\"xtra:image\" class=\"img-fluid\">\n  <\/picture>\n\n\n\n                    <div class=\"media-edit small m-1\">\n          <a href=\"\/media\/34\/edit\/edit\" target=\"_blank\">Edit<\/a>\n        <\/div>\n            <\/div>\n\n  \n            <figcaption class=\"figure-caption\">\n        Why do people assume that someone needing translation can read a word to toggle translation in a language other than the one they speak?\n      <\/figcaption>\n      <\/figure>\n<p>Many government websites rely on the deprecated <a href=\"https:\/\/developers.google.com\/search\/blog\/2020\/05\/google-translates-website-translator\">Google Translate Website Translator<\/a> to provide access to community members with limited proficiency in the provided language.<\/p>\n<p>The Google Translate Website Translator provides essentially the same level of site translation as submitting a URL to <a href=\"https:\/\/translate.google.com\/\">translate.google.com<\/a>, but without the visual cues to help a community member understand that the translation is not being provided by the site.<\/p>\n<p>Even the developers behind this service will admit it is a crutch to shore up the lack of full translation. The pandemic and the demand to translate health and safety information are why the <a href=\"https:\/\/developers.google.com\/search\/blog\/2020\/05\/google-translates-website-translator\">widget was partially revived from deprecation<\/a>. Basically, the governments, non-profits, and non-commercial websites allowed to use the widget are the sites that should not.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Client-side (browser-based) widgets are an incomplete and misleading solution.<\/p>\n<p>Policy makers, that speak the language of the government providing the content, assume the widget is providing access to critical content. Aside from providing an easy link to multilingual visitors, client-side translation is not increasing access.<\/p>\n<p>Community members with limited language proficiency that use government websites tend to be familiar with services to help them translate their content. Browsers, such as Chrome or Edge, will automatically attempt to translate pages in a language other than the system or browser setting. There are also dedicated mobile apps to help with client-side translation.<\/p>\n<p>If you speak enough of a language to find a page on a website, you probably know enough to figure out how to translate the page you found.<\/p>\n<p>The real equity issue is finding content in the first place if you don\u2019t speak the language.<\/p>\n<p>Websites that do not have translated content using an alternate URL are not being fully indexed in target languages by search engines such as Google, Bing, DuckDuckGo, etc. That means people who speak a language other than those used in fully-translated content are unable to use their language to search<\/p>\n<p>At a minimum, governments should consider automating the translation of content using machine translation\u2014usually via a web service that returns translated content\u2014that is stored in the database for presentation at a unique URL. It\u2019s important that this content is rendered as HTML as a language alternative for the source language rather than being rendered by Javascript in the browser.<\/p>\n<h2>Review translations with human professionals<\/h2>\n<p>While there are techniques for getting Google to index rendered Javascript, these approaches are not always reliable. Even though machine learning has progressed to the point that proxy-delivered translation is much more accurate, it still needs human review as of 2023.<\/p>\n<p>Best practice for all government websites should be full translation at a unique URL in a culturally appropriate design that may be translated by an on-demand service (for speed) but must be reviewed by skilled human translators for accuracy.<\/p>\n<p>That said, I'm not certain that relying on humans alone is adequate for all circumstances. In a project with the City of Portland, we compared interface translation\u2014elements like the \"home\" link or the \"search\" form\u2014that was done by a translation agency to the same translation generated through the Google Translate API. We were fortunately enough to have bilingual speakers of Spanish, Chinese, and Vietnamese on the team to review the results. Surprisingly, for these elements of the user interface, Google did better. Perhaps it should not have been a surprise. These agencies more typically translate documents, which have far more context than interface elements.<\/p>\n<p>The lesson learned was that you need to verify translations with trusted professionals regardless of whether you use human translators or machine translation\u2014or AI... more on that later.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Help search engines rank content with proper metatags<\/h2>\n<p>Search engines need data to help determine the relative importance of a page\u2014often in the form of metatags and HTML attributes. Search engines, such as Google, can use link elements (metatags) with a relationship (<code>rel=\u201dalternate\u201d<\/code>) and hreflang (<code>hreflang=\u201des\u201d<\/code>) attribute to help rank content. In this approach, the search engine gives a bit more relevance to translations (alternates) of pages that rank highly in English.<\/p>\n<p>Hreflang can be used to boost the search engine relevance of content both by language and by country or region. For example, you might have content tagged with <code>hrefang=\"en-US\"<\/code> as well as <code>hreflang=\"en-CA\"<\/code> and <code>hreflang=\"en-GB\"<\/code>. They all represent English as the language, but there might be differences in tone or spelling. Most governments will find themselves using a single country code\u2014or omit the country code\u2014for all language codes used for their content.<\/p>\n<p>Language codes are set by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), a governing body that defines language and region codes. It\u2019s not perfect\u2014and it is always changing\u2014but it serves as a means to ensure that the work you did to get your source content ranking will pass through to the content for your target languages.<\/p>\n<p>Here is an extreme example of hreflang implemented on a set of sites spread around the world all for the same brand:<\/p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-html\">&lt;link rel=\"alternate\" hreflang=\"en-AE\" href=\"https:\/\/www.cleanandcleararabia.com\/\"&gt;\n&lt;link rel=\"alternate\" hreflang=\"en-AU\" href=\"https:\/\/www.cleanandclear.com.au\/\"&gt;\n&lt;link rel=\"alternate\" hreflang=\"en-BH\" href=\"https:\/\/www.cleanandcleararabia.com\/\"&gt;\n&lt;link rel=\"alternate\" hreflang=\"en-CA\" href=\"https:\/\/www.cleanandclear.ca\/\"&gt;\n&lt;link rel=\"alternate\" hreflang=\"en-EG\" href=\"https:\/\/www.cleanandcleararabia.com\/\"&gt;\n&lt;link rel=\"alternate\" hreflang=\"en-GB\" href=\"https:\/\/www.cleanandclear.co.uk\/\"&gt;\n&lt;link rel=\"alternate\" hreflang=\"en-IN\" href=\"https:\/\/www.cleanandclear.in\/\"&gt;\n&lt;link rel=\"alternate\" hreflang=\"en-IQ\" href=\"https:\/\/www.cleanandcleararabia.com\/\"&gt;\n&lt;link rel=\"alternate\" hreflang=\"en-JO\" href=\"https:\/\/www.cleanandcleararabia.com\/\"&gt;\n&lt;link rel=\"alternate\" hreflang=\"en-KW\" href=\"https:\/\/www.cleanandcleararabia.com\/\"&gt;\n&lt;link rel=\"alternate\" hreflang=\"en-LB\" href=\"https:\/\/www.cleanandcleararabia.com\/\"&gt;\n&lt;link rel=\"alternate\" hreflang=\"en-MY\" href=\"https:\/\/www.cleanandclear.com.my\/\"&gt;\n&lt;link rel=\"alternate\" hreflang=\"en-NZ\" href=\"https:\/\/www.cleanandclear.co.nz\/\"&gt;\n&lt;link rel=\"alternate\" hreflang=\"en-OM\" href=\"https:\/\/www.cleanandcleararabia.com\/\"&gt;\n&lt;link rel=\"alternate\" hreflang=\"en-SA\" href=\"https:\/\/www.cleanandcleararabia.com\/\"&gt;\n&lt;link rel=\"alternate\" hreflang=\"en-SY\" href=\"https:\/\/www.cleanandcleararabia.com\/\"&gt;\n&lt;link rel=\"alternate\" hreflang=\"en-US\" href=\"https:\/\/www.cleanandclear.com\/homepage\"&gt;\n&lt;link rel=\"alternate\" hreflang=\"en-YE\" href=\"https:\/\/www.cleanandcleararabia.com\/\"&gt;\n&lt;link rel=\"alternate\" hreflang=\"fr-CA\" href=\"https:\/\/fr.cleanandclear.ca\/\"&gt;\n&lt;link rel=\"alternate\" hreflang=\"id-ID\" href=\"https:\/\/cleanandclear.co.id\/\"&gt;\n&lt;link rel=\"alternate\" hreflang=\"ms-MY\" href=\"https:\/\/www.cleanandclear.com.my\/ms\"&gt;\n&lt;link rel=\"alternate\" hreflang=\"ru-RU\" href=\"https:\/\/www.cleanandclear.ru\/\"&gt;\n&lt;link rel=\"alternate\" hreflang=\"th-TH\" href=\"https:\/\/www.cleanandclear.co.th\/\"&gt;\n&lt;link rel=\"alternate\" hreflang=\"vi-VN\" href=\"https:\/\/www.cleanandclear.com.vn\/\"&gt;\n&lt;link rel=\"alternate\" hreflang=\"zh-hans-CN\" href=\"https:\/\/www.cleanandclear.com.cn\/\"&gt;<\/code><\/pre><p>Government sites likely won't have this complexity, but you may find it helpful to to include geographic data to help search engines know a bit more about the jurisdiction's location. Here's an example from Portland.gov:<\/p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-html\">&lt;meta name=\"geo.placename\" content=\"Portland\" \/&gt;\n&lt;meta name=\"geo.region\" content=\"US-OR\" \/&gt;\n&lt;meta name=\"geo.position\" content=\"45.515012;-122.679096\" \/&gt;\n&lt;link rel=\"canonical\" href=\"https:\/\/www.portland.gov\/water\/customer-service\/pay-your-utility-bill\" \/&gt;\n&lt;link rel=\"alternate\" hreflang=\"x-default\" href=\"https:\/\/www.portland.gov\/water\/customer-service\/pay-your-utility-bill\" \/&gt;\n&lt;link rel=\"icon\" href=\"\/themes\/custom\/cloudy\/favicon.ico\" type=\"image\/vnd.microsoft.icon\" \/&gt;\n&lt;link rel=\"alternate\" hreflang=\"en\" href=\"https:\/\/www.portland.gov\/water\/customer-service\/pay-your-utility-bill\" \/&gt;\n&lt;link rel=\"alternate\" hreflang=\"es\" href=\"https:\/\/www.portland.gov\/es\/water\/customer-service\/pague-su-factura-de-alcantarillado-aguas-pluviales-y-agua\" \/&gt;\n&lt;link rel=\"alternate\" hreflang=\"vi\" href=\"https:\/\/www.portland.gov\/vi\/water\/customer-service\/thanh-toan-hoa-don-nuoc-thai-nuoc-mua-va-nuoc-cua-quy-vi\" \/&gt;\n&lt;link rel=\"alternate\" hreflang=\"zh-hans\" href=\"https:\/\/www.portland.gov\/zh-hans\/water\/customer-service\/zhifunindewushuiyushuihezilaishuizhangdan\" \/&gt;\n&lt;link rel=\"alternate\" hreflang=\"ru\" href=\"https:\/\/www.portland.gov\/ru\/water\/customer-service\/oplata-scheta-za-kanalizaciyu-drenazh-i-vodosnabzhenie\" \/&gt;<\/code><\/pre><p>The example from Portland.gov used a combination of the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.drupal.org\/project\/metatag\">Metatag<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.drupal.org\/project\/hreflang\">Hreflang<\/a> Drupal modules. To take it further, you can implement <a href=\"https:\/\/schema.org\/\">schema.org metadata<\/a>. All of this data will improve how search engines and AI interact with your content.<\/p>\n<h2>Index content by language to improve site search<\/h2>\n<p>In addition to making content available to search engines, full translation provides the opportunity to index text in a target language so that it can be found in site search. Sites that only use client-side machine translation lose the ability to submit forms to return search results in the target language. This is a huge loss of functionality! Would you find it acceptable if search could only return the occasional cognate or misspelling?<\/p>\n<p>Languages have unique grammar and syntax. Languages have their own writing system (alphabet) and unique characters and accents. If the search engine cannot provide at least a rudimentary search in the language, it is likely to cause confusion and frustration.<\/p>\n<p>For those that would argue that client-side translation is \u201cenough\u201d or \u201cthe best we can do\u201d, consider the basic usability of a site with thousands of pages of content where search is incomprehensible.<\/p>\n<p>So if you are trying to create a translated search interface, then it should include the interface elements such as the forms and filters with translated results.<\/p>\n<div class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-large\">\n  \n                    \t    <picture>\n                  <source srcset=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/uncropped_500w_webp\/public\/2025-08\/portlandgov-translation-search.png.webp?itok=q_0r4R5G 500w, \/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/uncropped_700w_webp\/public\/2025-08\/portlandgov-translation-search.png.webp?itok=URlatMfn 700w, \/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/uncropped_960w_webp\/public\/2025-08\/portlandgov-translation-search.png.webp?itok=Wu-UyZT- 960w\" media=\"all and (min-width: 500px)\" type=\"image\/webp\" sizes=\"100vw\" width=\"960\" height=\"540\">\n                  <img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/uncropped_500w_webp\/public\/2025-08\/portlandgov-translation-search.png.webp?itok=q_0r4R5G\" alt=\"Portland.gov has an excellent search experience in any language.\" title width=\"500\" height=\"281\" loading=\"lazy\" data-component-id=\"xtra:image\" class=\"img-fluid\">\n  <\/picture>\n\n\n\n                    <div class=\"media-edit small m-1\">\n          <a href=\"\/media\/37\/edit\/edit\" target=\"_blank\">Edit<\/a>\n        <\/div>\n            <\/div>\n<h2>Design your website with culture and word length in mind<\/h2>\n<p>Depending on the languages your site supports, you'll need to incorporate support for right to left languages and languages that have radically different word length for common user interface elements. (I'm looking at you German!)<\/p>\n<p>In addition to reading direction and word length, you may want to consider cultural differences for things like color, imagery, and tone.<\/p>\n<h2>Complex layouts cost more to translate<\/h2>\n<p>Drupal sites love their site building capabilities. Whether you use Layout Builder or Paragraphs or perhaps you are pining for the release of <s>Experience Builder<\/s> (er...) Drupal Canvas. These tools for keeping your content as semantic and structured while still being dynamic with may different layouts and appearance add a lot of complexity for translation.<\/p>\n<p>Think of it this way, if you have a body content field using CKEditor with content is is basically limited to semantic headings, lists, and paragraphs with minimal styling options, this field will be relatively each for a translator or translation API to replace that text with translation in a matching structure. Alternatively, if you have a complex layout builder solution with multiple sections that can accept a range of content blocks, each of those elements has to be submitted to the translation service. Each change to a block is a revision tied back to the overall content revision. These revision upon revision scenarios make it more and more difficult to ensure that each component is translated.<\/p>\n<p>So in short, if you are going to do widespread translation of services that need to update with any regularity, keep the layouts simple.<\/p>\n<h2>Avoid mixed translation<\/h2>\n<p>While mixed content (partially translated content presented on the same page as the source language) is indexed, partial translation can impact the usability for both the reader with limited language proficiency as well as native speakers from the source languages of the content.<\/p>\n\n\n<figure class=\"figure\">\n      <div class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-large\">\n  \n                    \t    <picture>\n                  <source srcset=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/uncropped_500w_webp\/public\/2025-08\/washco-example-of-mixed-translation.png.webp?itok=qvSBWCa2 500w, \/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/uncropped_700w_webp\/public\/2025-08\/washco-example-of-mixed-translation.png.webp?itok=zh01DkI6 700w, \/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/uncropped_960w_webp\/public\/2025-08\/washco-example-of-mixed-translation.png.webp?itok=BmJ3A5Gm 960w\" media=\"all and (min-width: 500px)\" type=\"image\/webp\" sizes=\"100vw\" width=\"960\" height=\"540\">\n                  <img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/uncropped_500w_webp\/public\/2025-08\/washco-example-of-mixed-translation.png.webp?itok=qvSBWCa2\" alt=\"Mixing the translation of titles makes content difficult to read and understand.\" title width=\"500\" height=\"281\" loading=\"lazy\" data-component-id=\"xtra:image\" class=\"img-fluid\">\n  <\/picture>\n\n\n\n                    <div class=\"media-edit small m-1\">\n          <a href=\"\/media\/38\/edit\/edit\" target=\"_blank\">Edit<\/a>\n        <\/div>\n            <\/div>\n\n  \n            <figcaption class=\"figure-caption\">\n        I hesitated a bit to share this example, but I think it is instructive of what mixed translation can do to the user experience.

Best practice is for this toggle to present the language label in the target language. So a site with translations in English, Spanish, Vietnamese, Russian, and Chinese would have language labels similar to this example from the Multnomah County Library.<\/p>\n<div class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-large\">\n  \n                    \t    <picture>\n                  <source srcset=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/uncropped_500w_webp\/public\/2025-08\/multcolib-translation-navbar.png.webp?itok=ZiwY2u_G 500w, \/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/uncropped_700w_webp\/public\/2025-08\/multcolib-translation-navbar.png.webp?itok=dbtRWL05 700w, \/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/uncropped_960w_webp\/public\/2025-08\/multcolib-translation-navbar.png.webp?itok=kDf-u8TF 960w\" media=\"all and (min-width: 500px)\" type=\"image\/webp\" sizes=\"100vw\" width=\"960\" height=\"159\">\n                  <img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/uncropped_500w_webp\/public\/2025-08\/multcolib-translation-navbar.png.webp?itok=ZiwY2u_G\" alt=\"The Multnomah County library uses a translation navigation which each language presented as an active or disabled link for each language.\" title width=\"500\" height=\"83\" loading=\"lazy\" data-component-id=\"xtra:image\" class=\"img-fluid\">\n  <\/picture>\n\n\n\n                    <div class=\"media-edit small m-1\">\n          <a href=\"\/media\/36\/edit\/edit\" target=\"_blank\">Edit<\/a>\n        <\/div>\n            <\/div>\n<p>When a language switch is presented as part of the navigation toolbar on a website, it is generally expected that it will switch into a fully translated version of that site with a starting point of the page being viewed.<\/p>\n<p>For sites that do not have enough content translated to warrant a sitewide translation navigation, an in-page approach may be more appropriate.

Regardless of format, HTML is likely the easiest to structure for accessibility, HTML content can be structured and styled for a range of device sizes and for screen reading technology. Files can be semantically structured for screen readers, but often fail to deliver a usable experience on mobile devices. (What device types would you assume to be most available to the population needing translation?)<\/p>\n<p>If files are preferred because of the way the information should be conveyed, such as flyers that might be posted in locations where speakers of that language are likely to see them, it is important to provide context for the language used in the file. This is often referred to as dual labeling.<\/p>\n<div class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-large\">\n  \n                    \t    <picture>\n                  <source srcset=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/uncropped_500w_webp\/public\/2025-08\/washco-residential-collection-service-rates.png.webp?itok=RWWDMXE2 500w, \/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/uncropped_700w_webp\/public\/2025-08\/washco-residential-collection-service-rates.png.webp?itok=BkyY7WLT 700w, \/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/uncropped_960w_webp\/public\/2025-08\/washco-residential-collection-service-rates.png.webp?itok=k6Rov08Y 814w\" media=\"all and (min-width: 500px)\" type=\"image\/webp\" sizes=\"100vw\" width=\"814\" height=\"238\">\n                  <img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/uncropped_500w_webp\/public\/2025-08\/washco-residential-collection-service-rates.png.webp?itok=RWWDMXE2\" alt=\"Example of labeling translated documents in a way that makes it clear what alternatives can be downloaded.\" title width=\"500\" height=\"146\" loading=\"lazy\" data-component-id=\"xtra:image\" class=\"img-fluid\">\n  <\/picture>\n\n\n\n                    <div class=\"media-edit small m-1\">\n          <a href=\"\/media\/39\/edit\/edit\" target=\"_blank\">Edit<\/a>\n        <\/div>\n            <\/div>\n<p>In the best examples of this approach, the source language of the document should be labeled next to the document name. Proper labeling is key to both the language speakers and those supporting those speakers that may not speak the target language.<\/p>\n<p>Avoid links to files with text like \u201cclick here\u201d or \u201cdownload now\u201d and explain what is to be downloaded with a meaningful title, the file type, and file size to be downloaded.<\/p>\n<p>File size is important. Large file sizes are inequitable for government information as only those with enough data can download them. There may be file types that are unavailable to the device type being used to access the information. Additionally, some file types are more difficult to make accessible in any language.<\/p>\n<h2>Translating images and video<\/h2>\n<p>Translated media that is related back to its source also makes it easier to see what has not been translated yet or when the media has outdated translations using tools like Drupal's <a href=\"https:\/\/www.drupal.org\/project\/tmgmt\">Translation Management Tool<\/a> module.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>There is a lot of metadata for media like images, video, and audio in addition to the generated file that can be translated, including:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Alternative text<\/li>\n<li>Transcripts<\/li>\n<li>Displayed titles<\/li>\n<li>Closed captioning<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>Reduce translation costs with plain language<\/h2>\n<p>The easiest way to reduce translation costs is to reduce the amount of text translated. Clear, concise content is easier for people to understand and costs less to maintain as well.<\/p>\n<p>Here is an example of two passages generated with ChatGPT to meet different language levels:<\/p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Post graduate reading level<\/th>\n<th>8th-grade reading level<\/th>\n<\/tr>\n<\/thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Landscape design integrates ecological principles with aesthetic considerations to create harmonious outdoor spaces that serve both functional and experiential purposes. This discipline transcends mere garden planning; it involves a comprehensive understanding of environmental context, plant selection, and spatial dynamics. Effective landscape design addresses site-specific conditions\u2014such as topography, climate, and soil composition\u2014while also engaging with cultural and historical narratives. By employing sustainable practices, such as xeriscaping and native plant usage, landscape architects not only enhance biodiversity but also promote resilience against climate change. Ultimately, thoughtful landscape design cultivates a dialogue between human activity and the natural environment, fostering spaces that inspire connection, reflection, and stewardship.<\/td>\n<td>Landscape design is about planning and creating beautiful outdoor spaces like parks and gardens. It involves picking the right plants, flowers, and trees to make a place look nice and useful. Good design considers the shape of the land, the weather, and the soil. Designers often use local plants that grow well and need less water, which helps the environment and supports wildlife. In short, landscape design aims to make outdoor areas that are pretty and enjoyable for everyone.<br>&nbsp;<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/tbody>\n<\/table>\n<p>As this example highlights, the sheer amount of text is vastly different.<\/p>\n<h2>Start considering how AI might reduce translation costs while improving the quality<\/h2>\n<p>AI translation is improving rapidly. In some ways, translation via a large language model (LLM) is one of the more mature uses of AI. However, the newer AI models like ChatGPT and Claude struggle a bit with some translation, creating passages of text that are grammatically accurate but not necessarily something any human would express. I don't expect this to be the case for long. Similar to the shift from search to using AI for internet queries, I think we will see a move from traditional translation APIs such as Google's or Microsoft's towards AI platforms. It's a huge challenge to how translation has worked for the past 10-15 years.<\/p>\n<p>Drupal is poised to integrate well with these services. Drupal CMS even includes some basic \"translate using AI\" capabilities.<\/p>\n<div class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-large\">\n  \n                    \t    <picture>\n                  <source srcset=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/uncropped_500w_webp\/public\/2025-08\/drupal-translate-using-ai.png.webp?itok=SAZbSLX1 500w, \/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/uncropped_700w_webp\/public\/2025-08\/drupal-translate-using-ai.png.webp?itok=-0FlP-C_ 700w, \/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/uncropped_960w_webp\/public\/2025-08\/drupal-translate-using-ai.png.webp?itok=0DQG9tGG 960w\" media=\"all and (min-width: 500px)\" type=\"image\/webp\" sizes=\"100vw\" width=\"960\" height=\"232\">\n                  <img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/uncropped_500w_webp\/public\/2025-08\/drupal-translate-using-ai.png.webp?itok=SAZbSLX1\" alt=\"Drupal's translation interface with AI options enabled.\" title width=\"500\" height=\"121\" loading=\"lazy\" data-component-id=\"xtra:image\" class=\"img-fluid\">\n  <\/picture>\n\n\n\n                    <div class=\"media-edit small m-1\">\n          <a href=\"\/media\/40\/edit\/edit\" target=\"_blank\">Edit<\/a>\n        <\/div>\n            <\/div>\n<p>The default prompt in the Drupal AI module for translation is helpful in understanding just how impactful AI translation might be.<\/p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-plaintext\"> You are a helpful translator that can translate text and understand context when translating.\n You will be given a context text to translate from the source language {{ source_lang_name }}\n to the target language {{ dest_lang_name }}.\n Only respond with the actual translation and nothing else.\n When translating the context text from the source language {{ source_lang_name }}\n to the target language {{ dest_lang_name }} take the following instructions into consideration:\n 1.

Implementing translations on large sites serving a number of languages can be complex.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>The initial investment in your content management systems is incremental compared to the impact. That said, fully supporting all of the languages spoken in a community, including features such as permitting or online payment, may be prohibitively expensive for even the most well-funded jurisdictions.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>You may not be able to get it perfect in a single, short-term project. Your website is a product that can change over time and continuously improve. By striving to be better, government organizations can improve service to their communities and improve equity.<\/p>\n<h2>Get help<\/h2>\n<p>Do any of these best practices sound like the next step your organization should take?
