If you are like me, you'll probably want to disable these tours after viewing them yourself the first time. They are helpful to understand the Tour module, but they are a bit of a distraction after you understand the tool. Similarly, you may see tours that have been added by other modules. For instance, on a recent project, I found a number of enabled tours from contributed modules I was using like the Search API module. Personally, I know Search API pretty well, so these were a bit of a distraction.
