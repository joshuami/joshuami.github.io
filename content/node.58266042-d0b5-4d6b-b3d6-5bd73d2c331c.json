Every time you download a copy of Drupal or any projects on Drupal.org, you talk to ftp.drupal.org. (We see over 400,000 downloads of Drupal core in a typical month\u2014way more around DrupalCons and major community sprints.)<\/p><p>Each month we have over 15 million unique pageviews on Drupal.org\u2014by over 2 million unique visitors.<\/p><p>All of those stats are about to rise significantly with the launch of Drupal 8.

The impact was immediate. Everything was faster. We met our initial goal of getting Drupal.org sites and services fronted by a CDN.<\/p><p>That CDN solution was a good start, and while it lacked features we didn\u2019t know we needed, it improved our ability to deliver Drupal-generated content as well as packaged projects.<\/p><p>Late in 2014, we were introduced to Fastly.

In our case we chose the Seattle POP because of its proximity to our servers at the &lt;a href=\u201dhttp:\/\/osuosl.org\u201d&gt;OSL&lt;\/a&gt; in Corvallis, Oregon in the United States.<\/p><p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.drupal.org\/files\/caching-basics-1st-request-withshielding.png\" alt=\"Caching basics\" \/><\/p><p>The origin shield configuration means all requests to Drupal.org flow through Fastly\u2019s origin server in Seattle before reaching our Drupal.org origin.

That has been a huge help when we need to make a hot fix to production and keep Drupal.org delivering Drupal to the world.<\/p><h3>Logging and improving our usage stats<\/h3><p>Fastly also allows us to <a href=\"http:\/\/fastly.us\/1lnEQed\">stream our logs<\/a>.
