Arguably, the product has changed quite a bit since that time\u2014circa Windows XP.<\/p><p>Summing up the biggest difference in collaboration between Microsoft Office365 suite compared to more polished offerings like G Suite, Microsoft assumes files will be passed back and forth between users while Google assumes that you will collaborate in real time. This is a huge difference.<\/p><p>Microsoft has not updated the basic premise of Office, and related tools such as Sharepoint, in over 15 years. They may feel they don\u2019t need to change due to marketshare or that Office365 is an adequate response to online-only suites like Google\u2019s\u2014but neither would be the case.<\/p><p>Microsoft\u2019s marketshare is erroding quickly in small to medium sized businesses that are looking for a simpler maintenance and licensing model without expensive IT support. Even slower to change organizations at the enterprise level are responding to their power users that insist on better collaboration tools. These organizations are looking at alternatives to the Microsoft suite for file sharing and collaboration.<\/p><p>I don\u2019t want a single company to own a monopoly over every aspect of our online life.

They are simpler when they need to be\u2014there are no maddeningly complex \u201cribbons\u201d to contend with\u2014and they are much more stable when collaborating. I remember Office before it adopted the ribbon. It was easier to use. I\u2019m not sure what user research drove Microsoft to the ribbon, but I think the testing had to have been flawed\u2014not just because G Suite is easier for me to use. Microsoft has lost marketshare to simpler productivity tools over recent years.<\/p><p>As a comparrison, look at the G Suite Docs experience versus Word experience in Office365.<\/p><p><img src=\"\/public\/images\/microsoft-word-complexity.png\" alt=\"Microsoft Word has added so many features that it has become virtually unusable.\" \/><\/p><p><img src=\"\/public\/images\/google-docs-simplicity.png\" alt=\"G Suite's Docs application is limited to the features you need to start and progressively exposes advanced features to power users.\" \/><\/p><h2 id=\"settle-on-a-model-that-is-saas-based-and-api-first\">Settle on a model that is SaaS-based and API-first<\/h2><p>Heck, even <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Satya_Nadella\">Satya Nadella<\/a> wants to see a seamless experience between all devices.

What even is a \u201cfirstline worker\u201d in the context of productivity tools? There is a different price point for each that contains a different set of software.
