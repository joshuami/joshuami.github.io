In DrupalCon Austin, I had members of my team learn how to maintain the testbot infrastructure so that we could take over the process of spinning up bots and dealing with spikes in demand.<\/p><p>By early 2015, we had optimized the old testbots as much as they were going to be optimized. We moved them to AWS so we could spin up faster machines and more bots, but there were features that were waiting on the new DrupalCI infrastructure that were blocking key development on Drupal 8.<\/p><p>In March of 2015, we invited all the community developers that had helped with DrupalCI to the Drupal Association offices in Portland and sprinted with them to figure out the remaining implementation needs. The next couple of months involved tweaking DrupalCI\u2019s architecture and cutting out any nice to have features to get something launched as soon as possible.It is no coincidence that from the time of DrupalCI\u2019s launch until the release of Drupal 8, progress was rapidly accelerated.<\/p><p>I am immensely proud of the work of all the community members and staff that worked directly with core maintainers to unblock Drupal 8 development and make it faster.

We moved them to AWS so we could spin up faster machines and more bots, but there were features that were waiting on the new DrupalCI infrastructure that were blocking key development on Drupal 8.<\/p>\n<p>In March of 2015, we invited all the community developers that had helped with DrupalCI to the Drupal Association offices in Portland and sprinted with them to figure out the remaining implementation needs. The next couple of months involved tweaking DrupalCI\u2019s architecture and cutting out any nice to have features to get something launched as soon as possible.It is no coincidence that from the time of DrupalCI\u2019s launch until the release of Drupal 8, progress was rapidly accelerated.<\/p>\n<p>I am immensely proud of the work of all the community members and staff that worked directly with core maintainers to unblock Drupal 8 development and make it faster. This work was critical.<\/p>\n<p>Thank you to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.drupal.org\/u\/jthorson\">jthorson<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.drupal.org\/u\/ricardoamaro\">ricardoamaro<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.drupal.org\/u\/nick_schuch\">nick_schuch<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.drupal.org\/u\/dasrecht\">dasrecht<\/a>,<a href=\"https:\/\/www.drupal.org\/u\/basic\">basic<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.drupal.org\/u\/isntall\">isntall<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.drupal.org\/u\/drumm\">drumm<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.drupal.org\/u\/mikey_p\">mikey_p<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.drupal.org\/u\/mixologic\">mixologic<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.drupal.org\/u\/hestenet\">hestenet<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.drupal.org\/u\/chx\">chx<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.drupal.org\/u\/mile23\">mile23<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.drupal.org\/u\/alexpott\">alexpott<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.drupal.org\/u\/dawehner\">dawehner<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.drupal.org\/u\/Shyamala\">Shyamala<\/a>, and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.drupal.org\/u\/webchick\">webchick<\/a>.

Also thank you to anyone who chimed in on IRC or in the issue queues to help us track down bugs and improve the service.<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"whats-next-for-testing-drupal\">What\u2019s next for testing Drupal<\/h2>\n<p>Most of the future state of testing is outlined in the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.drupal.org\/node\/2696421\">Drupal.org Testing Policy for DrupalCI<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Key issues that we still need to solve are related to concurrent testing improvements and new test types to support. While we have PhantomJS integrated with the test runner, there are optimizations that need to happen.<\/p>\n<p>Testing is not an endpoint. Like much of our work, it is an ongoing effort to continuously improve Drupal by providing a tool that improves how we test, what we test, and when we test.<\/p>\n",
