# Building Reveal.js Presentations

This directory contains reveal.js presentations that are built locally using Vite instead of using CDN resources.

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. Build for production:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

## Development

For development with hot reloading:
```bash
npm run dev
```

Preview production build:
```bash
npm run preview
```

## File Structure

- `src/reveal-entry.js` - Main entry point that imports reveal.js and plugins
- `theme-joshuami.css` - Custom theme styles
- `template.html` - Template using local assets
- `index.html` - Main entry point for Vite
- `dist/` - Built assets (generated by Vite)

## Available Scripts

- `npm run dev` - Start development server with hot reload
- `npm run build` - Build production assets
- `npm run preview` - Preview production build
- `npm run clean` - Clean dist directory

## Creating New Presentations

1. Copy `template.html` to create a new presentation:
   ```bash
   cp template.html your-presentation-name/index.html
   ```

2. Edit the new file to customize your presentation

3. The presentation will use the locally built reveal.js assets

## Assets

The build process creates optimized assets in the `dist/` directory:
- JavaScript bundles with reveal.js core and plugins
- CSS files with reveal.js styles and your custom theme
- Optimized and minified for production

## Configuration

The reveal.js configuration is in `src/reveal-entry.js`. You can modify the initialization options there to change default behavior for all presentations.

The Vite configuration is in `vite.config.js` at the project root.
