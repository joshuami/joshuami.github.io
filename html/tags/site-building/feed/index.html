  <title>Taking a Tour of the Tour Module</title>
  <link>https://joshuami.com/blog/2025/tour-module</link>
  <description>Tour was deprecated in Drupal 10 and removed in Drupal 11.0. I was fine with that as I had not used it before, but I recently needed a tour for an upcoming launch of an intranet. Tour kinda blew my mind with its easy setup and out of the box look and feel.</description>
