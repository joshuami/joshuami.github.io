  <title>This Blog is on Drupal CMS (Starshot)... Kinda... for Now</title>

  <description>Way back in 2015, I moved my blog to a static implementation using Jekyll and Github Pages. While I was very involved in Drupal, I also was very aware of my limited time to keep a Drupal installation up to date. I simply wanted/needed the security a static site ensured. Drupal CMS—and a little extra holiday free time—led me to test a new approach using a Starshot installation while keeping the site static using Tome and  Github Pages.</description>
