  <title>Vibe Coding a Blog Post into Session Slides for BADcamp</title>
  <link>https://joshuami.com/blog/2025/vibe-coding-blog-post-session-slides-badcamp</link>
  <description>A couple months back I wrote about the new recipe unpacking feature in Drupal. The post received a fair bit of attention and was requested as a session at the Bay Area Drupal Camp (BADcamp). I continue to look for ways to leverage AI for something useful, so I decided to ask it to help me create Reveal.js slides.</description>

  <title>Getting Rid of Unused Media with the Entity Usage Module</title>
  <link>https://joshuami.com/blog/2025/getting-rid-unused-media-entity-usage-module</link>
  <description>A client recently needed to audit a number of documents (mostly PDFs) that were unexpectedly appearing in Google search results. The easiest way to identify documents that needed to be archived was to review unused media. Media that was not referenced by field or embedding.</description>

  <title>Taking a Tour of the Tour Module</title>
  <link>https://joshuami.com/blog/2025/tour-module</link>
  <description>Tour was deprecated in Drupal 10 and removed in Drupal 11.0. I was fine with that as I had not used it before, but I recently needed a tour for an upcoming launch of an intranet. Tour kinda blew my mind with its easy setup and out of the box look and feel.</description>

  <title>Recipe Unpack: This Blog Is No Longer on Drupal CMS, and That's a Good Thing</title>
  <link>https://joshuami.com/blog/2025/recipe-unpack-blog-no-longer-drupal-cms-and-thats-good-thing</link>
  <description>With the release of Drupal 11.2, the Recipes feature gets an important new capability. You can now "unpack" recipes after they are run so that your composer.json will have the direct dependencies from the recipe rather than a dependency on the recipe itself.</description>

  <title>This Blog is on Drupal CMS (Starshot)... Kinda... for Now</title>
  <link>https://joshuami.com/blog/2024-12/blog-drupal-cms-starshot-kinda-now</link>
  <description>Way back in 2015, I moved my blog to a static implementation using Jekyll and Github Pages. While I was very involved in Drupal, I also was very aware of my limited time to keep a Drupal installation up to date. I simply wanted/needed the security a static site ensured. Drupal CMS—and a little extra holiday free time—led me to test a new approach using a Starshot installation while keeping the site static using Tome and  Github Pages.</description>
