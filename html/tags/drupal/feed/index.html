      <title>Recipe Unpack: This Blog Is No Longer on Drupal CMS, and That's a Good Thing</title>
      <link>https://joshuami2.ddev.site/blog/2025/recipe-unpack-blog-no-longer-drupal-cms-and-thats-good-thing</link>
      <description>With the release of Drupal 11.2, the Recipes feature gets an important new capability. You can now "unpack" recipes after they are run so that your composer.json will have the direct dependencies from the recipe rather than a dependency on the recipe itself.</description>

      <title>This Blog is on Drupal CMS (Starshot)... Kinda... for Now</title>
      <link>https://joshuami2.ddev.site/blog/2024-12/blog-drupal-cms-starshot-kinda-now</link>

While I was very involved in Drupal, I also was very aware of my limited time to keep a Drupal installation up to date. I simply wanted/needed the security a static site ensured. Drupal CMS—and a little extra holiday free time—led me to test a new approach using a Starshot installation while keeping the site static using Tome and Github Pages.</description>
