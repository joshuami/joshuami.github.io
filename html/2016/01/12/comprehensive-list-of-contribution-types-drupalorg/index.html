<p>This is an extensive list of contribution types that we either track or could track. It should be noted that this is not comprehensive. There are forms of contribution that do not leave behind data that cannot be collected. That said, this list does cover lots of types of contribution and not just code.</p>
<p>If we were to apply some math to this data, we could calculate an engagement score for users and organizations. Tracking engagement over time could be a key health metric.</p>
<p>Many of these contribution types would make profiles and organization pages more robust and would be less subjective than self-reported information.</p>
