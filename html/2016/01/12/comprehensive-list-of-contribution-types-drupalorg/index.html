(i.e. "more than 100 document edits") Cannot credit to orgs</td></tr><tr><td>Documentation section maintained</td><td>X</td><td></td><td>Not yet tracked</td><td>This will be possible with new documentation tools defined in the content strategy.</td></tr><tr><td>Forum posts created</td><td>X</td><td></td><td>Not displayed</td><td>Technically, you can see these as posts by the user, but it is not a total and not limited to forum posts.</td></tr><tr><td>Forum comments</td><td>X</td><td></td><td>Not displayed</td><td>Technically, you can see these as comments by the user, but it is not a total and not limited to forum comments.</td></tr><tr><td>DrupalCons sponsored</td><td></td><td>X</td><td>Not displayed</td><td>We have this for most past DrupalCons.</td></tr><tr><td>Supporting partner status</td><td></td><td>X</td><td>Displayed on profile</td><td>Supporting partners fund Drupal.org—both infrastructure and staffing costs.</td></tr><tr><td>Membership status</td><td>X</td><td>X</td><td>Displayed on profile</td><td>Individual or organization membership</td></tr><tr><td>Donations and support to the Drupal Association</td><td>X</td><td>X</td><td>Not tracked</td><td>We have totals of money spent with the Drupal Association, but we'd need to aggregate this information and likely abstract it to levels.</td></tr><tr><td>Jobs posted</td><td>X</td><td>X</td><td>Not displayed</td><td>Technically, we could show this for users, but I'm not sure there is value.</td></tr><tr><td>Issues created</td><td></td><td>X</td><td>Displayed</td><td>Kinda. This is really "posts" of all types on the user profile.</td></tr><tr><td>Issue comments</td><td>X</td><td></td><td>Displayed</td><td>Kinda. This is really "comments" of all types on the user profile.</td></tr><tr><td>Issues followed</td><td>X</td><td></td><td>Not displayed</td><td>This seems like an excellent engagement metric.</td></tr><tr><td>Projects followed</td><td>X</td><td></td><td>Not displayed</td><td>Also an excellent engagement metric.</td></tr><tr><td>User/interest groups owned/maintained</td><td>X</td><td></td><td>Not displayed</td><td>From Groups.drupal.org data</td></tr><tr><td>User/interest group membership</td><td>X</td><td></td><td>Not displayed</td><td>From Groups.drupal.org data</td></tr><tr><td>User/interest group participation</td><td></td><td>X</td><td>No displayed</td><td>By count of nodes created or comments posted</td></tr><tr><td>Local user groups sponsored</td><td></td><td>X</td><td>Not tracked</td><td>Great organization metric</td></tr><tr><td>Camps sponsored</td><td></td><td>X</td><td>Not tracked</td><td>Camps would need to help us track this and submit their data to staff for upload.</td></tr><tr><td>DrupalCon session submissions</td><td>X</td><td></td><td>Not displayed</td><td>We have this data for quite a few past DrupalCons.</td></tr><tr><td>DrupalCon speaker</td><td>X</td><td></td><td>Not displayed</td><td>We have this data for quite a few past DrupalCons.</td></tr><tr><td>DrupalCon Trainer</td><td>X</td><td>X</td><td>Not displayed</td><td>We have this data for quite a few past DrupalCons.</td></tr><tr><td>BoF sessions submitted</td><td></td><td>X</td><td>Not displayed</td><td>We have this data for quite a few past DrupalCons.</td></tr><tr><td>Translations strings submitted</td><td>X</td><td></td><td>Not displayed</td><td>From localize.drupal.org.

This shows up on the marketplace listings, but not on the profile.</td></tr><tr><td>Employees on Drupal.org</td><td></td><td>X</td><td>Displayed on profile</td><td>This display could use some work. Acquia's page takes about 10 seconds to load because the list of users is so long.</td></tr><tr><td>Drupal Planet Posts</td><td>X</td><td>X</td><td>Not tracked</td><td>This could be tied back to users with a little customization</td></tr><tr><td>Camps organized</td><td>X</td><td></td><td>Not tracked</td><td>We might be able to pull this from the groups data with some modifications to the roles/management types.</td></tr><tr><td>User/interest groups organized</td><td>X</td><td></td><td>Not tracked</td><td>We might be able to pull this from the groups data going forward</td></tr><tr><td># of mentees listing as a mentor</td><td>X</td><td></td><td>Not displayed</td><td>This is similar to the concept of "followers", but people community focused.</td></tr><tr><td>Is board member</td><td>X</td><td></td><td>Not tracked</td><td>We could put this on profiles</td></tr><tr><td>Core maintainer</td><td>X</td><td>X</td><td>Not tracked</td><td>Orgs it could be "hires a core maintain"</td></tr><tr><td>Sprint mentor</td><td>X</td><td></td><td>Not tracked</td><td>Wouldn't this be awesome? We'd have to decide what sprints qualify—just DrupalCons or all big sprints at camps and Dev Days.</td></tr><tr><td>Staff</td><td>X</td><td></td><td>Not tracked</td><td>Hey, we know all our staff, but most people don't know if they are talking to a full time Drupal Association employee.</td></tr><tr><td>Elevated role on Drupal.org</td><td>X</td><td></td><td>Not displayed</td><td>We've given special privileges to these people. It would be nice to highlight that.</td></tr><tr><td>Working group member</td><td>X</td><td></td><td>Not tracked</td><td>This would help people understand governance roles a bit better.</td></tr><tr><td>Security team member</td><td>X</td><td></td><td>Not tracked</td><td>We list all of these users, but it would be nice to show it as a badge on their profile pic for interactions in the issue queues.</td></tr><tr><td>DrupalCon volunteer</td><td>X</td><td></td><td>Not tracked</td><td>We have the data in spreadsheets and thank you notes. It really should show up on profiles.</td></tr><tr><td>DrupalCon attendee</td><td>X</td><td>X</td><td>Not displayed</td><td>Technically, people self-report this information right now, which means it is not accurate. Org would be a little difficult to track on this one, but it could possibly be done</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Global Training Days organizer</td><td>X</td><td>X</td><td>Not tracked</td><td>We'd have to import this data.</td></tr><tr><td>IRC support</td><td>X</td><td></td><td>Not tracked</td><td>This would require people to give credit to people with IRC handles listed on Drupal.org. Maybe we could use the Karma points from IRC.</td></tr></tbody></table></div></div></article></div></div>
